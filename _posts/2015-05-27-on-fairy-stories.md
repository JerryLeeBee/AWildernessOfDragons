In 1939 Tolkien delivered the Andrew Lang lecture, his topic 'Fairy Stories'. It first appeared in print (as 'On Fairy-stories') in 1947. The definitive edition today is *Tolkien on Fairy-Stories*, edited by V. Flieger and D. Anderson (2008). 

Tolkien's lecture on 'Fairy-stories' (henceforth OFS) was delivered just as he was getting to grips with the writing of *The Lord of the Rings*. It is usually regarded as a sort of meta-meditation by means of which Tolkien clarified to his own satisfaction just what he was doing in writing this sequel to *The Hobbit*. For example, in one of the sections of the essay Tolkien argues forcefully against the conventional notion that children provide the proper audience for fairy stories. In so doing he was clearly establishing in his own mind that, in contrast to *The Hobbit* (which originated as a story for his own children), *The Lord of the Rings* would be a fairy story of adults. In their introduction to the 2008 edition, Flieger and Anderson point to a number of ways in which this resolution translated into differences in the story of Frodo and the Ring in contrast to that of Bilbo and the Dwarves.

What is *not* usually considered is the ways in which this essay provided for Tolkien a meditation upon the content as much as the form of *The Lord of the Rings*.
