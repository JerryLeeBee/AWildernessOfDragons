>The dark lord sits in the tower and looks over the dark seas and the dark world [and] his hand stretches over the cold sea and the dead world.

This quote just blows me away. It is from *Return of the Shadow* (HoME, VI), an early draft of the story of Barrow Downs (I think in the final draft the line is reduced to ‘till the dark lord lifts his hand’).
