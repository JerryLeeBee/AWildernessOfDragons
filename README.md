### Tentative title and theme: 'The vision of enchantment: far-sight in Tolkien's stories'

How are we to understand the important role accorded to visual magic in the great spell of enchantmnet that we know as *The Lord of the Rings*?

For Tolkien the audience of a fairy story are enchanted by the words of the story. Telling enchanted stories is an Elvish art. But Elves are also magical beings, possesing (among other qualities) far-sight; they can also make magical objects (e.g. palantíri) that give far-sight to mortal men. Magical vision is a central motif in Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings*: Sauron as the great eye in the Dark Tower; Galadriel with her mirror, the palantíri, not to mention various dreams and other moments (such as Frodo at Amon Hen). Is it a coincidence that magical *vision* is so prominent in this enchanted *story*?
