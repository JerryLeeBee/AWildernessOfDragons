### Tentative title and theme: 'Fairy stories and fairy visions'
Tolkien consistently championed the idea of fairy *stories*. In his early *Book of Lost Tales* the stories are literally tales told by the elves (and recorded by a mortal man), while in his famous essay 'On Fairy-Stories' Tolkien insisted that stories, and not drama, were the fitting media for fairy stories. This emphasis on *stories* of course complemented Tolkien's philological research and native genius. Yet there is running through his (later?) stories a visual theme. Sauron is a lidless eye in the dark tower, Galadriel has her mirror, and Elendil and his sons brought to Middle-earth seven stones, the Palant√≠ri, that show events far away. What is the relationship of this 'elvish technology' to the story? Is Tolkien providing a glimpse into a more spiritual mode of story-telling, lost to mortal men, or are these magical means of far-seeing simply unconnected to the art of song?

### Timeline
The project consists of two phases:

(1) To Septmber 1st 2015: initial research (Wiki) and discussion (blog posts), culminating in an abstract of the argument and a proposal for the paper.

(2) To March 1 2016: paper composed via github (essay).
