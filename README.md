### Tentative title and theme: 'Enchantment & magic: words and vision'

For Tolkien fairy stories are instances of an Elvish art of enchantment - the audience of a fairy story are enchanted by the words of the story. Elves are also magical beings, possesing (among other qualities) far-sight; they can also make magical objects (e.g. palantíri) that allow far-sight to mortal men. This magic of vision occupies central positions in Tolkien's great fairy story of *The Lord of the Rings*: Sauron as the great eye in the Dark Tower; Galadriel with her mirror, the seven stones or palantíri, by means of one first Sauruman and then Aragorn confront the spirit of Sauron. 

How are we to understand the important role accorded to visual magic in the great spell of enchantmnet that we know as *The Lord of the Rings*?
