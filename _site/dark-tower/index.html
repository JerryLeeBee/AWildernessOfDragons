			<h2>Dark Tower</h2>
			
<div class="byline">by <a href="mailto:simonjohncook@gmail.com">Simon J. Cook</a> on May 22, 2015</div>

			<div class="postcontent"><blockquote>
<p>The dark lord sits in the tower and looks over the dark seas and the dark world [and] his hand stretches over the cold sea and the dead world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote just blows me away. It is from <em>Return of the Shadow</em> (HoME, VI), an early draft of the story of the Barrow Downs (I think in the final draft the line is reduced to ‘till the dark lord lifts his hand’).</p>

<p>Now, it is <a href="https://github.com/uoou/AWildernessOfDragons/wiki/Orthanc">here</a> suggested that Elostirion, the Elf-tower on the Tower Hills (Emyn Beraid) west of Hobbiton, was the <em>original</em> tower out of which was unfolded Orthanc (by way of Frodo&#39;s dreams).</p>

<p>Consider, then, this quotation from &#39;The Tower of Cirith Ungol&#39; in <em>Return of the King</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Shadow that bred them can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its
own. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frodo is here speaking about Orcs. (He continues: &#39;I don’t think it gave life to the orcs, it only ruined them and twisted them...&#39;). </p>

<p>But perhaps the same could be said about towers and vision itself? In which case Elostirion, once home to the Seeing-Stone (the Palantír that looks West, over the sundering sea, back to Faërie) becomes the original, not only of Orthanc, but also of Barad-dûr, where dwelled the Great Eye of Sauron.</p>
